# Native interceptors

The native interceptor is the brain-side interception載体 injected into the
`claude` process. Its job is identical on both platforms — turn the intercepted
`open`/`read`/`stat`/`readdir`/subprocess calls for *routed* paths into fs
IO-RPC to the adapter — but the injection mechanism differs, so there are two
implementations.

| Platform | Mechanism | Source | Why not the other |
|---|---|---|---|
| macOS | `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` interpose dylib | [`macos/rcc_interpose.c`](macos/rcc_interpose.c) | Bun on macOS goes through libSystem, so interpose cleanly catches its I/O (design doc §4.1.3). |
| Linux | `seccomp-user-notify` supervisor | [`linux/rcc_seccomp.c`](linux/rcc_seccomp.c) | Bun on Linux issues **raw** syscalls that bypass glibc, so `LD_PRELOAD` misses its file I/O; seccomp traps at the syscall boundary and catches everything (design doc §4.1.3). |

Both were ported from the validated POC (`/tmp/rcc-poc`, design doc §4–§5). The
material change from the POC is that per-op data no longer comes from a local
store on disk — it is fetched from the adapter via the binary IO-RPC protocol
([`internal/protocol`](../internal/protocol)), so the adapter's routing table
decides local-vs-remote.

## Building

```sh
make -C native/macos    # -> native/macos/rcc_interpose.dylib
make -C native/linux     # -> native/linux/rcc_seccomp
```

or `make native` from the repo root (builds the host platform's interceptor).

## Injection contract

The adapter (see [`internal/adapter/launch.go`](../internal/adapter/launch.go))
sets these environment variables on the `claude` process, and both interceptors
read them:

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `RCC_ADAPTER_SOCK` | Unix socket the interceptor dials for fs IO-RPC. |
| `RCC_REMOTE_PREFIXES` | `:`-joined path prefixes to forward (remote-allowlist). |
| `RCC_SPAWN_PROXY` | Path to `rcc-spawn-proxy` (macOS subprocess forwarding). |
| `RCC_SPAWN_SENTINEL` | Env marker that forces a subprocess remote (macOS). |

Handle lifecycle: the interceptor keeps a file's `open`/`read`/`close` sequence
on a single connection to the adapter, so the adapter's per-connection handle
table (and the executor's per-stream one) stay valid across the sequence.

## Platform differences worth knowing

- **macOS `$NOCANCEL` variants are load-bearing.** libSystem routes ~73% of file
  opens through `open$NOCANCEL`/`openat$NOCANCEL`, and Bun uses
  `pread$NOCANCEL`/`close$NOCANCEL`. Missing any of them silently corrupts reads
  or drops writes (design doc §4.1 point 2, §4.1.2). All variants are hooked.
- **macOS requires a re-signed claude.** `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` is ignored for a
  hardened-runtime binary, so the adapter runs an ad-hoc re-signed *copy*
  (`--resign`); the original install is never touched (design doc §4.2).
- **Linux fetches whole files, not slices (current limitation).** seccomp only
  traps `openat`; the injected fd's later `read`/`lseek` are real syscalls we no
  longer see, so `rcc_seccomp` fetches the whole routed file into a memfd up
  front. Lazy slicing needs trapping `read`/`lseek` too or a FUSE backing store —
  future work (design doc §4.1.3 step 2, §4.3).
- **Linux needs privilege.** `NEW_LISTENER` + `ADDFD` require `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` or a
  user-namespace setup; the POC used `--privileged --security-opt
  seccomp=unconfined` (design doc §4.1.3).
